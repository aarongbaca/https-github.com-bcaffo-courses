I'm glad that you decided to take Statistical Inference, part of the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins Biostatistics! This course presents the fundamentals of statistical inference that you will need throughout the rest of the Data Science track. We believe that the key word in Data Science is "science".

This Specialization is focused on providing you with three things: (1) an introduction to the key ideas behind working with data in a scientific way that will produce new and reproducible insight, (2) an introduction to the tools that will allow you to execute on a data analytic strategy, from raw data in a database to a completed report with interactive graphics, and (3) on giving you plenty of hands-on practice so you can learn the techniques for yourself. This course represents the most fundamental and foundational component of the series. Using only a bare minimum of mathematics, we attempt to give students the fundamentals of using statistics to draw inferences about populations.

We are excited about the opportunity to attempt to scale Data Science education. We intend for the courses to be self-contained, fast-paced, and interactive.

A couple of first week housekeeping items. First, make sure that you've had R Programming and the Data Scientist's Toolbox before taking this class. At a minimum you must know: very basic git and basic R.

An important aspect of this class is to peruse the materials in the github repository. All of the most up to date material can be found here

https://github.com/bcaffo/courses/tree/master/06_StatisticalInference

You should clone this repository as your first step in this class and make sure to fetch updates periodically. (Please send pull requests too!) It is one of the most essential components of the Specialization that you start to use Git frequently. We're practicing what we preach as well by using the tools in the series to create the series, especially git.

You can clone the whole repo with (http)

git clone https://github.com/bcaffo/courses.git

or (ssh)

git clone git@github.com:bcaffo/courses.git

The lectures are in the index.Rmd lecture files. In Data Products, we'll cover how to create these sorts of slides. However, for the time being, you should be able to open them in R Studio and look at their contents. You will see all of the R code to recreate the lectures. Going through the R code is the best way to familiarize yourself with the lecture materials.

If you'd prefer to watch the videos on YouTube, the current version of the class is here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ
